Summons (working title) is a game based off 16-bit Strategy RPGs like Ogre Battle and Master of Monsters. You control a summoner who must use your summoned allies to destroy an opposing summoner. Your summons evolve as they win battles and find treasures. Your abilities are strengthed by control of towers on the map, until you are powerful enough to mount an unstoppable assault.

Features in development:
- Maps generated from text files.
- Selectable and moveable characters.
- Ability to summon new units.
- UI allows for status of your team and of individual units.
- Ability for units to fight each other when coming in contact.
- Ability to set destination for each unit and have them move towards that location each turn a distance depending on their movement statistics.

- Ability to play a complete game from start to finish.
- Findable relics/XP/mana spread throughout the map (hidden perhaps?).
- Selectable behaviors for units (auto move towards or away from enemy units, or defend a location).
- Unit animations when moving and attack.
- One time effect spells for summoners (instead of just summoning units).
- Special effect where appropriate.
